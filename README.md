## 1) Local Setup:
 * clone this repository on your local system with `git clone https://github.com/AttentivU/blueberry-AttentivU.git`


## 2) Create and Activate Virtual Environment:
 * run `conda create -n [venv_name] python=3.10 pip`
 * run `conda activate [venv_name]`

 * Note: If `which python3` still returns local python from within the conda environment you should execute `conda deactivate` twice to deactivate (base) and rerun `conda activate [venv_name]`. This will set the correct python path. 


## 3) Install Dependencies:
 * run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies


## 4) Run experiment:

 `python run.py [subject_id] [trial_id]`

 * [subject_id] should be subject name or some other unique identifier
 * [trial_id] should uniquely identify the trial if the same subject does the experiment more than once (e.g. 1,2,3,...)

## Modifying Timings:
edit lines 14-20 of run.py to change length of breaks, number of math/rest sets per part, number of math problems per math period, and length of each math problem

## 5) Data:
* data will be saved in data/[subject_id] as [trial_id]L.csv, [trial_id]R.csv, and [trial_id]F.csv from left, right, and forehead devices respectively
* timing information is saved after each part in data/[subject_id]/[trial_id].pkl 
* if a file already exists the data will be appended


## Test Recording:
 * `python record.py -a [MAC address] -u [subject_id] -r [trial_id]`
 * ex: `python record.py -a 3E8847D9-3D52-7A2F-B913-2FBD9F63ECF3 -u nat -r 4`

## Test Connection:
 * `python test_connection.py` attempts to connect to all three devices

## Blueberry Device MAC Addresses:
to see MAC addresses run `python ble_devices.py` and edit lines 91-96 of record.py to reflect what they are on your device
